## Trigger Actions Framework

### [FinalizerHandler](trigger-actions-framework/FinalizerHandler.md)

The `FinalizerHandler` class is a utility class that handles the execution of dynamic finalizers. 
 
Finalizers are classes that implement the `TriggerAction.DmlFinalizer` interface and are defined in Custom Metadata. 
Finalizers can be used to perform custom actions after all DML operations have completed. 
 
The `FinalizerHandler` class provides the following functionality: 
 
- A way to bypass the execution of specific finalizers. 
- A way to check if a specific finalizer is bypassed. 
- A way to clear all bypasses. 
- A way to handle dynamic finalizers. 
--- 
To use the `FinalizerHandler` class, you must first create a Custom Metadata type called `DML_Finalizer__mdt` . 
The `DML_Finalizer__mdt` Custom Metadata type must have the following fields: 
 
- `Apex_Class_Name__c` : The name of the Apex class that implements the finalizer. 
- `Order__c` : The order in which the finalizer should be executed. 
- `Bypass_Execution__c` : A flag that indicates whether or not the finalizer should be bypassed. 
- `Bypass_Permission__c` : The permission required to bypass the finalizer. 
- `Required_Permission__c` : The permission required to execute the finalizer. 
--- 
Once you have created the `DML_Finalizer__mdt` Custom Metadata type, you can create finalizers by creating records 
in the `DML_Finalizer__mdt` object. 
 
To bypass the execution of a specific finalizer, you can call the `bypass` method of the `FinalizerHandler` class. 
To check if a specific finalizer is bypassed, you can call the `isBypassed` method of the `FinalizerHandler` class. 
To clear all bypasses, you can call the `clearAllBypasses` method of the `FinalizerHandler` class. 
 
To handle dynamic finalizers, you can call the `handleDynamicFinalizers` method of the `FinalizerHandler` class. 
The `handleDynamicFinalizers` method will instantiate and execute all finalizers that are not bypassed.

### [FlowChangeEventHeader](trigger-actions-framework/FlowChangeEventHeader.md)

A flow-accessible version of the ChangeEventHeader class for use in 
a flow handler of a change data capture event.

### [MetadataTriggerHandler](trigger-actions-framework/MetadataTriggerHandler.md)

The `MetadataTriggerHandler` class is a trigger handler that executes Trigger 
Actions defined in Custom Metadata. 
 
This class implements the `TriggerAction` interface for all supported Trigger Operations: 
 
- `BeforeInsert` 
- `AfterInsert` 
- `BeforeUpdate` 
- `AfterUpdate` 
- `BeforeDelete` 
- `AfterDelete` 
- `AfterUndelete` 
--- 
The `MetadataTriggerHandler` class reads from the `Trigger_Action__mdt` Custom Metadata type to 
define Trigger Actions. 
 
Each Trigger Action must specify the following information: 
 
- `Apex_Class_Name__c` : The name of the Apex class that implements the Trigger Action. 
- `Order__c` : The order in which the Trigger Action should be executed. 
- `Flow_Name__c` : The name of the Flow to execute (optional). 
- `Bypass_Permission__c` : The permission required to bypass the Trigger Action (optional). 
- `Required_Permission__c` : The permission required to execute the Trigger Action (optional). 
- `Allow_Flow_Recursion__c` : Whether or not to allow the Flow to recurse (optional). 
--- 
 
The `MetadataTriggerHandler` class also uses the `sObject_Trigger_Setting__mdt` Custom Metadata type to define 
Trigger Action settings for specific sObjects. 
 
Each sObject Trigger Setting must specify the following information: 
 
- `Bypass_Permission__c` : The permission required to bypass the Trigger Action for the specified sObject (optional). 
- `Required_Permission__c` : The permission required to execute the Trigger Action for the specified sObject (optional). 
--- 
 
To use the `MetadataTriggerHandler` class, you must create a Trigger on the desired sObject and specify the 
 `MetadataTriggerHandler` class as the handler. 
You can then define Trigger Actions and sObject Trigger Settings in Custom Metadata to control the behavior of the Trigger. 
 
**Example:** 
 
```apex
trigger AccountTrigger on Account (
  before insert,
  after insert,
  before update,
  after update,
  before delete,
  after delete,
  after undelete
) {
    new MetadataTriggerHandler.run();
}
```

 
This example will execute all Trigger Actions defined in Custom Metadata for the `Account` sObject.

### [TriggerAction](trigger-actions-framework/TriggerAction.md)

The `TriggerAction` class defines the interfaces that should be implemented by Trigger Actions. 
 
Trigger Actions are classes that define the logic that should be executed before or after a DML operation on a record. 
The `TriggerAction` class defines the following interfaces: 
 
- `BeforeInsert` : This interface defines the logic that should be executed before a new record is inserted. 
- `AfterInsert` : This interface defines the logic that should be executed after a new record is inserted. 
- `BeforeUpdate` : This interface defines the logic that should be executed before a record is updated. 
- `AfterUpdate` : This interface defines the logic that should be executed after a record is updated. 
- `BeforeDelete` : This interface defines the logic that should be executed before a record is deleted. 
- `AfterDelete` : This interface defines the logic that should be executed after a record is deleted. 
- `AfterUndelete` : This interface defines the logic that should be executed after a record is undeleted. 
- `DmlFinalizer` : This interface defines the logic that should be executed after all DML operations have completed. 
--- 
To implement a Trigger Action, you must create a class that implements one or more of the `TriggerAction` interfaces.

class that is used to handle change events. 
 
Change events are events that are generated when a record is created, updated, or deleted. 
The `TriggerActionFlowChangeEvent` class provides the ability to access the change event header in the Flow interview. 
 
To use the `TriggerActionFlowChangeEvent` class, you must first create a Flow that accepts a variable of
